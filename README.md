docker-hostname-ping
====================

On a stock installation of Ubuntu based distributions comes with dnsmasq via NetworkManager. We can take advantage of this to generate a new file like `/etc/hosts` called `/etc/hosts.docker` which is read by `dnsmasq` for instant DNS updates on containers statuses.

In action:

    $ docker start stupefied_pare
    stupefied_pare
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

## Installation

There are few parts that need to be installed.

* copy `additional-dnsmasq.conf` to `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/docker`
* add the contents of docker-bashrc.sh to your `.bashrc`
* copy `rebuild_docker_hosts.py` to your `bin` (e.g. `$HOME/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)
* enable your user to sudo to `nobody` without a password (I have a docker group, so I use `%docker ALL=(nobody) NOPASSWD: ALL`)
